# AutoGen Society of Mind â€“ Disaster Management Scenario

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description

This project demonstrates an **AutoGen Society of Mind (SoM)** approach to disaster management during a major flood in Bihar.
The system uses multiple agents arranged into **Inner Teams** and **Outer Teams** to coordinate planning, risk analysis, resource allocation, and communication with human oversight.

The **UserProxyAgent** acts as the main interface for human feedback and decision-making.
